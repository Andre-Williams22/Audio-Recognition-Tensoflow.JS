# Voice Recognition with Tensorflow.JS
This repositiory displays the code that takes the machine learning algorithm called classification and applies it to audio. 

The code utilizes the web browser WebAudio API that's built off of TensorFLow.js The dataset used to train the neural network is called the Tensoflow Speech Command Dataset.
